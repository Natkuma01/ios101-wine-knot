#### 🧠🧠🧠 Three ideas come up during the brainsotrming process:

## 1. Pokémon Character Profile App
An app that allows users to look up Pokémon characters by name or energy type.
* Users can search by character name or filter by energy type.
* Each character profile will display an image, weaknesses, abilities, and moves.
* Data will be fetched from this API: https://rapidapi.com/chimpanceinalambrico/api/pokemon-data-api/playground/apiendpoint_4d01be1f-fd7b-4c22-8a33-2a5c521455a2


## 2. Animal sounds education app
This app is designed for infants and young children to learn how different animals sound — with a fun twist.
* The landing page features a wheel decorated with different animal icons.
* Tapping on a section of the wheel plays the corresponding animal sound.
* To make it more playful, the animal sounds will replace the lyrics of Rihanna’s song “Work.”

For example, if the user selects a cow, the app might play:

Moo moo moo moo moo
He said me haffi
Moo moo moo moo moo
He see me do
Moo moo moo moo moo
(It won’t play the full song — just a fun snippet.)

## 3. Wine Inventory Tracker
A mobile application to help restaurant owners track wine inventory, analyze pricing, and display wine profiles. This app complements the desktop version of my other wine management project.
* The landing page displays all restaurants. Users can create new ones.
* Selecting a restaurant leads to its wine list, where users can add or delete wines.
* Tapping on a wine reveals its profile, including: Region, category, vineyard, vintage, tasting profile, food/dishes to pair with
* On the profile page, an inventory button shows current stock and pricing details, such as Selling price, buying price, and margin cost. Users can adjust the margin to experiment with different selling prices.
* avaliable API to mock the wine data (POST):

### 📃 APP EVALUATION CRITERIA
## Pokémon Character Profile App
1. 📱 **Mobile:** 
This app has a strong potential to be more than just a mobile-friendly website. To make the experience uniquely mobile, we could push notifications for featured Pokémon of the day, or even use the camera and AR to display a character’s profile in a real-world setting. These enhancements would make the app feel immersive and native to mobile rather than just a Pokédex on a small screen.
2. 📽️ **Story:** 
The app is for Pokémon fans who want an easy, engaging way to explore the world of Pokémon from their phones. Whether someone is a longtime fan or a new player trying to learn more about energy types and abilities, this app becomes a personal guide to the Pokémon universe. It’s the kind of app you’d recommend to a friend who’s just gotten into Pokémon or plays Pokémon GO and wants quick access to character info on the go.
3. 📊 **Market:**
The Pokémon fanbase is massive and global, from kids to adults, gamers to collectors. While this app won’t target every single fan, it offers high value to who are into character stats, battling strategies, or just love learning more about the Pokémon universe.
4. ⏳ **Habit:**
This app can be habit-forming in a light, playful way. Users might open it regularly to look up new Pokémon they come across in games, shows, or just out of curiosity. It’s also fun to explore random characters and discover their unique traits. The ability to see each Pokémon’s energy type and weaknesses makes it a useful tool for planning battles—whether in a game. Over time, it can become a go-to resource for fans who want quick, reliable info right at their fingertips.
5. 🔮 **Scope:**
The core functionality—searching Pokémon by name or energy type and viewing character profiles—is well-defined and very achievable. It’s not technically overwhelming, especially since we’ll be using a third-party API. Even a stripped-down MVP that lets users search and view basic profiles would still be useful and enjoyable. From there, features like offline mode, AR, or interactivity could be layered in later. The path is clear, and the end goal is realistic within the timeline.

## Wine Inventory Tracker
1. 📱 **Mobile:** 
This app really makes sense as a mobile experience for restaurant owners and managers are constantly on the move. Being able to check or update inventory from their phone without needing to go back to a desktop is a huge win. To make the experience feel even more native to mobile, we could explore features like push notifications for low stock alerts or scanning wine labels using the camera to quickly pull up profiles. It’s more than just a scaled-down desktop tool—it’s a hands-on companion that works in the fast-paced restaurant field.
2. 📽️ **Story:** 
This app solves a real issues for restaurant owners—managing wine inventory. Not only does it help track what’s in stock, but it also gives insights into pricing and profit margins, all from a phone. The added bonus of seeing tasting notes and food pairings means it could also be useful during staff training or customer interactions.
3. 📊 **Market:**
The restaurant industry is huge, and the need for smart, simple tools like this is very real. While the app may not appeal to the general public, it provides huge value to a niche group—restaurant owners, sommeliers, and hospitality managers. It’s valuable for small to mid-size restaurants or wine bars that don’t have expensive, all-in-one systems. Your audience is well-defined, and they’ll appreciate an app designed specifically for their workflow, not some generic inventory system.
4. ⏳ **Habit:**
This app can form a solid habit for users, especially if they manage inventory daily or weekly. They might open it regularly to check current stock, adjust pricing based on margin, add new wines or delete wines out of stock on their list; use tasting notes/ food pairing info to train staff. Guests can also view the list through their phone to get wine info while sommeliers are busy.
5. 🔮 **Scope:**
The core experience of viewing wine lists, tracking inventory, editing pricing, and showing wine details—is clear and achievable within a typical program timeline. It’s technically manageable, especially with mock APIs available. Even a stripped-down MVP with just restaurant creation, wine listings, and pricing adjustments would be super valuable. What makes this app even more exciting is that it’s designed to complement a desktop version I'm also developing. While they operate independently for now, there's a clear future opportunity to link them together, giving users a seamless experience across platforms. That long-term vision adds depth to the project, while still keeping the current mobile scope focused and doable. (Desktop version: https://github.com/Natkuma01/wine_not)
