#### Description
This is a wine inventory tracker mobile app which designed to help restaurant owners and managers efficiently manage their wine inventory. It allows users to add and organize wine lists by restaurant, track inventory levels, analyze pricing, and view detailed wine profiles including tasting notes, food pairings, region, and vineyard information. This app is designed as a mobile companion to an desktop project (still in development process), with a long-term goal of integrating both platforms for a seamless, multi-device experience.

#### App Evaluation
##### Mobile:
This app is a great fit for mobile because restaurant staff and managers are often on the go and need quick access to wine data and inventory status. The mobile version enhances the user experience by offering real-time inventory management, with future potential to add features like barcode scanning and push notifications for low stock alerts. It's more than a glorified web app. It's a useful tool in a fast-paced, hands-on environment.

##### Story:
This app can solve a common issue for restaurant owners—managing wine inventory efficiently and profitably. The app also adds value by allowing users to adjust pricing margins on the fly and access wine education details like tasting notes and food pairings, which can be useful for training or customer service.

##### Market:
The app targets a niche but highly valuable audience such as small to mid-sized restaurants, bars, and wine-focused businesses that may not have large-scale POS systems. The hospitality industry is vast, and this tool addresses a specific operational need within that space. With potential future integrations like syncing to POS or accounting systems, the marketability could expand even further.

##### Habit: 
Users are likely to return to the app regularly for inventory checks, pricing adjustments, or wine detail lookups. It supports both content consumption like wine profiles and adding and managing inventory, which helps with engagement. With enhancements like stock notifications and weekly reports, the app could become a routine part of a manager’s workflow.

##### Scope:
The MVP will include restaurant creation, wine list management, inventory/pricing control, and profile views. This mobile app also complements a desktop version already in progress. While they function separately now, there’s a defined path to integrate both platforms in the future, which adds long-term value without complicating the short-term roadmap.
